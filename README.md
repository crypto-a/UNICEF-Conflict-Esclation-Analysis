# UNICEF Conflict Esclation Analysis

> UNICEF, or the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, is a United Nations agency that focuses on providing humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries. As their resources are limited, UNICEF has to decide which countroes they should prioritize and help. To aiutomate this process they developed three AI models that would go through diffrent data they had access too from diffrent countries and predict weather or not the cournty will have a conflict esclation or not. In this project we have the data as well as the predictions. The goal is to create a linear regression model to determine where each of these models produce a better out come and which model should UNICEF use for each country.
